description: The Dorothy Dale series, published by the world-renowned Stratemeyer
  Syndicate under the pen name Margaret Penrose, was one of the first series marketed
  toward a young female audience. The series pairs strong moral lessons with a heaping
  dose of action-adventure that will capture and keep the attention of even reluctant
  readers.
